**Collaboration**
When a user creates a pull request from a fork that they own, the user
generally has the authority to decide if other users can commit to the
pull request's compare branch. If the pull request author wants greater
collaboration, they can grant maintainers of the upstream repository
(that is, anyone with push access to the upstream repository) permission
to commit to the pull request's compare branch
